# risk-perception-and-higher-order-interactions
This work develops a two-layer framework with a simplicial complex to explore epidemic spreading in the context of related information. One layer depicts information spreading, and the other represents epidemic spreading. In the information layer, there are three transmission pathways: pairwise interactions, higher-order interactions, and cumulative emotion, and the UAU model is utilized. In the physical contact layer, the diffusion of the epidemic is studied by the SIS model. 
This project contains the scripts and data that can be divided into seven sections. 
beta: The file describes the variation of each node over time in ER and BA networks. 	
mu: This file describes the infection prevalence versus the recovery probability   under different  .
lamda+lamdadelta: This file depicts the effect of risk-perception emotion on the steady-state of the infected density.
compare: This file depicts the performance and functionality of the approach with some well known previous works.
emotion: This file depicts the evolution of emotional heterogeneity.
threshold : This file describes the epidemic threshold versus model parameters.
Real-world: This file describes some experiments on real-world datasets
